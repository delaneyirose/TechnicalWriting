Create a Private Channel
1. Private channels are channels within a team that can only be accessed by team 
members and guests that have been added to the private channel.
2. A user may want to create a private channel to limit collaboration to specific users, or 
prompt communication between a specific group of people who are assigned to a 
project, but do not want to create a new team.
